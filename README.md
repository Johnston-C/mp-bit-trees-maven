**Instructions for use**

To use this program, you need to use arguments on the command line. The first argument is expected to be 'ascii', 'braille', or 'unicode', which specifies what you are converting to. 'ascii' and 'unicode' expect inputs of a length that is a multiple of 6, which is a braille representation of some characters. 'braille' just expects a String of letters (and possibly spaces). Exceptions can be handled.

Some example inputs: braille "Hello World" , unicode 110010100010111000111000101010 , ascii 110010100010111000111000101010
